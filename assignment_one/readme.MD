## Client Server Application

Implementation of client-server architecture from lowest level.

Client requests specific imagename to the server.

Server has various images. 

A specific packet was given to students, and we were to create the packet from scratch and send it to the client via a socket connection.

EXAMPLE.MOV is a demonstration of the project.
