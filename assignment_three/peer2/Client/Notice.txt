Hi there,

The lab conditinoally works with some iamges, subt some do not work. The bug present is very hard to fix as it as to do with the closeness caculation. 
Clients only have two options in their DHT as each peer seems to replace one another. Clients can get easily stuck in a "deadlock" of sorts as the DHTs don't seem to popualte properly.
